### Exploring Dimensionality Reduction techniques

Investigated the effect of varying labelling noise in a dataset on the dimensionality reduction algorithms.
Worked on tSNE and MDS algorithms. 

Please see [report](modified_final2.pdf) for the detailed analysis.

The ipython notebook is present [here](modified_final.ipynb).
